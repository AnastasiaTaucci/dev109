            <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering from Bellevue College, building on a foundation established with my bachelor's degree in Biochemistry. My passion for learning new technologies drives me to seek innovative solutions to real-life problems. With six years of experience in the healthcare industry, I have developed a keen understanding of how technology can significantly improve people's lives.</p>
            <p>Now, I am eager to leverage my skills to create and enhance websites and apps, recognizing their critical role in our modern world. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and learning Spanish, activities that keep me inspired and continuously learning.</p>
